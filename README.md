Building a convolutional neural network that can detect if a picture is a bird or not. 

There is a free dataset called CIFAR-10 that contains 6,000 pictures of birds and 54,000 pictures of nine other kinds of 
objects that are not birds.

Here is how objects are labeled in CIFAR10:

Image Type:
airplane automobile bird cat deer dog frog horse ship truck

Class Label:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
